# Ultrasonic-maze-solver
An autonomous robot that navigates a maze using ultrasonic sensors. By emitting sound waves and measuring the echo, it detects walls and obstacles. An onboard microcontroller processes this data, executing a wall-following algorithm to intelligently find the path from start to finish without collision.
